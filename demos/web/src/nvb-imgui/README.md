# nvb-imgui
A very immediate mode gui made to reinvent the wheel of guis. The gui is based upon the concept of *actions*. To use the framework, one needs to make an enum of actions and then specify what that action does when it is dispatched. See the example gui in *main.ts* to understand the syntax.
